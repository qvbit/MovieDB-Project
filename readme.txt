One search page:

Page S1: A page that lets users search for an actor/actress/movie through a keyword search interface. (For actor/actress, you should examine first/last name, and for movie, you should examine title.)
Your search page should support multi-word search, such as "Tom Hanks". For multi-word search, interpret space as "AND" relation. That is, return all items that contain both words, "Tom" and "Hanks". Since the search page is for actor/actress/movie, so if there was a movie named "I love Tom Hanks!", it should be returned. As for the output, you should sort them in a way that users could find an item easily.
